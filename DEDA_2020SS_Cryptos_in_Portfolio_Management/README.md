# Project Description
In this project Yuliya Gustap and Arash Moussavi together with the Blockchain Research Center of Humboldt University of Berlin attempted to determine the effects of introducing cryptocurrencies into a traditional diversified portfolio, which includes stocks, fixed income, commodities and currencies.
*CRIX* - the diversified crytocurrency index - was used as a proxy of the whole cryptocurrency universe. 
The total of four portfolios were estimated using the Maximum Diversification rule: two portfolios estimated by Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH (DCC-GARCH) with and without CRIX, and two more portfolios estimated by Assymtric Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH (ADCC-GARCH) with and without CRIX. 

# Project Results
The two portfolios with CRIX (both DCC-GARCH and ADCC-GARCH) outperformed on several metrics, such as mean return, coefficient of variation, Sharpe and Sortino ratio. 
However, they also demonstrated higher standard deviation and higher maximum drawdown than portfolios without CRIX. 
*The results imply that although including cryptocurrrencies into a traditional portfolio increases it's risk, it increases the ruturn by a higher degree, leading to higher risk-adjusted return.*
